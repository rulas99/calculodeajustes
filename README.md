# calculodeajustes
In this repository I share some scripts to adjust mesurements, more specifically values obtained in topographic work but it also appliable to experimental data.

In EcCon.ipynb I compute the condition equations to adjust distances for a calibration base with n points (3â‰¤n<11)

In Tarea2.ipynb I made the adjustment for a nivelation network with two fixed stations
